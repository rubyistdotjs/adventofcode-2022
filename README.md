# Advent of Code 2022

**My solutions written in [Go](https://go.dev/) for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.**

Each day has its own folder in which you have the part one and two excerpt with the validated answers in the README and the input that was given to me.

I'm still learning the language. Unfortunately I don't have enough free time to keep up with the daily challenges.
